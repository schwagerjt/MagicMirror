Raspberry Pi 3+ Magic Mirror/Smart Mirror software

I am interested in tweaking the software for the Magic Mirror to include the following:

Internet Date/Time
Monthly Appointment Calendar (Google)  with audible warnings when it's time to leave for appointments...

Current Local Weather (Hourly Forecast for Current Day with picture representing present weather condition)
7-day Weather Forecast with option to page to Satellite image / Radar Weather...

News Headlines (scrollable)

At a minimum, I would like to be able to display this on a monitor hooked up to the Raspberry Pi 3+.  

Future ideas include voice activation with an Alexa / Siri-like capability, face recognition, jokes and/or a daily inspirational quote...
